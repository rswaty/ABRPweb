Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/rswaty/ABRPweb/tree/cad522b1182a7fa275326c3c720b7c688ce06038" target="_blank">cad522b</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/pine.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/pine.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/pine.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<h3>Data cleaning notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>worked from data delivered by Beatriz (INSERT LINK AND NAME OF FILE)</li>
<li>added “B-P” column, concatenated BU and Plot numbers to generate unique value for charts</li>
<li>added MONYEAR and LASTBURNYEAR columns for charts (also, some burns only had years recorded). Used “text to columns” tool in Excel with “/” as the delimeter to create new YEAR-based columns where possible. Manually entered years for many records.</li>
<li>Bull-dozing happened (instead of fire?) for MONYEAR 2007, B-Ps 7_8, 7_7, 7_6, and 7_4. Did not transfer this information to LASTBURNYEAR (but is is in LASTBURN column). Swaty did not want to mix numerical and text data types in the LASTBURNYEAR column.</li>
<li>B-Ps 7_3, 7_5 was missing MONDATE information for 2019. Swaty manually entered “2019” based on exploring neighboring plots in the dataset.</li>
<li>Found many typos and case issues (e.g., “Seedling” instead of “SEEDLING”)</li>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
