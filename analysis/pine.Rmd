## Pine Data

### Data cleaning notes
* worked from data delivered by Beatriz (INSERT LINK AND NAME OF FILE)
* added "B-P" column, concatenated BU and Plot numbers to generate unique value for charts
* added MONYEAR and LASTBURNYEAR columns for charts (also, some burns only had years recorded).  Used "text to columns" tool in Excel with "/" as the delimeter to create new YEAR-based columns where possible.  Manually entered years for many records.
* Bull-dozing happened (instead of fire?) for MONYEAR 2007, B-Ps 7_8, 7_7, 7_6, and 7_4.  Did not transfer this information to LASTBURNYEAR (but is is in LASTBURN column). Swaty did not want to mix numerical and text data types in the LASTBURNYEAR column.
* B-Ps 7_3, 7_5 was missing MONDATE information for 2019.  Swaty manually entered "2019" based on exploring neighboring plots in the dataset.
