This website contains the cleaned long-term monitoring datasets, basic exploratory charts, LANDFIRE maps and documentation for the [Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve](https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/apalachicola-bluffs-and-ravines-preserve/).  


## Goals

The overall goal of this project was to organize and explore the long-term monitoring data so that the Florida chapter could:

* assess future monitoring needs
* explore effectiveness of treatments
* be set up for efficient future data recording

Plus have LANDFIRE data-based maps for landscape context.

## Deliverables include:

* cleaned data sets (uploaded to this [Box folder](https://tnc.box.com/s/dxuc1z646svvlkswcp3sp2ii75w8dk9l))
* charts of
    * pine stem counts over time by size class, separate chart per Burn Unit-Plot.  Pine data split into seedlings, class A, grouped and all. 
    * wiregrass percent cover over time, separate chart per Burn Unit-Plot. See all charts on Perennial Grass Charts page. 
* LANDFIRE maps
* *this draft website* which was mostly created as a sandbox and for learning/teaching by the developer.  Also serves as additional documentation and contains code for data processing and charts.  Click "Source Code" button to get all datasets and code.
