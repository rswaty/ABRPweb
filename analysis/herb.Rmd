## Herbaceious Data

### Data cleaning notes

* Saved as "herbWU.xsls"
* Assumed "99999" meant "no data". Changed to "NA".  Looks like (at least for some years) only one quadrat was sampled for % PG, % WP, % OP, % LI AND % BG.
* Did nothing with blank cells.
* Deleted row with AVERAGES
* * Bull-dozing happened (instead of fire?) for MONYEAR 2007, B-Ps 7_8, 7_7, 7_6, and 7_4.  Did not transfer this information to LASTBURNYEAR (but is is in LASTBURN column). Swaty did not want to mix numerical and text data types in the LASTBURNYEAR column.
