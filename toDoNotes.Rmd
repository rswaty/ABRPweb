To do list:

* make sure that legend/people information is included
* insert map (include treatment shapes?)
* links to raw and clean data?
* make charts:
    * Pines – by plot.  Showing number of stems over time within each size class:  seedlings, A-J.
    * From herbaceous:
        * Wiregrass/perennial grass over by plot.   
        * %PG from herbaceous data.  One graph for each plot with mean of quadrats 1-20 – add confidence interval?
    * any canopy charts?
* insert LANDFIRE page (from ABRPwfArchive)
