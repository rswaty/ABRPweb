To do list:

* add "documentation" page
        * legend/people information is included
        * links to datasets
* insert map (include treatment shapes?)
* links to raw and clean data?
* make charts:
    * Pines – by plot.  Showing number of stems over time within each size class:  seedlings, A-J.
        * try heatmap where each "row" is a BUP, each colum is a year, color is # of seedlings (perhaps the difference between BUP and 5), and there is a separate one for each seedling size
    * From herbaceous:
        * Wiregrass/perennial grass cover by plot.   
        * %PG from herbaceous data.  One graph for each plot with mean of quadrats 1-20 – add confidence interval?

* insert LANDFIRE page (from ABRPwfArchive)
