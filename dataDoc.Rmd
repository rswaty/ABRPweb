This document serves to document changes made to datasets (will be repeated on website) and provide links to datasets.

## Goals and deliverables Phase 1
In general the aim of Phase 1 for ABRP is to get the data wrangled and to provide input that guides future monitoring, and eventually management.  

**Deliverables**

1. Cleaned datasets.  All datasets located in [this folder](https://tnc.box.com/s/dxuc1z646svvlkswcp3sp2ii75w8dk9l)
2. Charts of pine stems and wiregrass
3. LANDFIRE Maps and charts
4. Website with downloadable code

## Pine Data Wrangling
* worked from data delivered by Beatriz **ABRP_bioplots_1995-2018**
* added "B-P" column, concatenated BU and Plot numbers to generate unique value for charts
* added MONYEAR and LASTBURNYEAR columns for charts (also, some burns only had years recorded).  Used "text to columns" tool in Excel with "/" as the delimiter to create new YEAR-based columns where possible.  Manually entered years for many records.
* Bull-dozing happened (instead of fire?) for MONYEAR 2007, B-Ps 7_8, 7_7, 7_6, and 7_4.  Did not transfer this information to LASTBURNYEAR (but is is in LASTBURN column). Swaty did not want to mix numerical and text data types in the LASTBURNYEAR column.
* B-Ps 7_3, 7_5 was missing MONDATE information for 2019.  Swaty manually entered "2019" based on exploring neighboring plots in the dataset.
* Found many typos and case issues (e.g., "Seedling" instead of "SEEDLING")
* In pine.csv:
    * deleted 21_4 data for 2001
    * deleted 40_10 data for 1998

    
**Note-deletions only done in "pine.csv".  ABRP_bioplots_1995-2018 was left intact.**
    
## Pine Data 
There are multiple files with "pine" in the name.  Most were for charts.

1. pine.csv **main pine dataset.**  Raw, but note processing steps above.  Some data deleted.  
2. for comparing stem counts to reference sites (BU 5)
    * averagePineStemsBU
    * pineBU5all
    * pineStemsBU5average
3. For heatmaps
    * pineDiverge (intermediate dataset. Not used in charts.)
    * fiveStems (intermediate dataset. Not used in charts.)
    * comparePineClean 
    
## Grouping of Pine Data
David and Chaz provided a grouping scheme.  This was added to the pine data as a new columm, then due to time was formatted for the final dataset. 

## Datasets with names pineClassAonly, pineSeedlingsOnly, pineNoBPH were taken from the pineAll.csv by filtering, copy/paste


## Wiregrass data wrangling
In general worked with ABRP_bioplots_1995-2018 herb tab, then saved that to herb.WU.csv.  Wiregrass (perGrass.csv) data is a refinement of herb data. 

* All cleaned Herbaceous data saved as "herbWU.csv"
* For Perennial Grasses, that data was copied and pasted into a new spreadsheet, "perGrass.csv".   Used Pivot Table in herbWU.csv to create this new spreadsheet.  
* Assumed "99999" meant "no data". Changed to "NA".  Looks like (at least for some years) only one quadrat was sampled for % PG, % WP, % OP, % LI AND % BG.
* Did nothing with blank cells.
* Deleted rows with AVERAGES
* * Bull-dozing happened (instead of fire?) for MONYEAR 2007, B-Ps 7_8, 7_7, 7_6, and 7_4.  Did not transfer this information to LASTBURNYEAR (but is is in LASTBURN column). Swaty did not want to mix numerical and text data types in the LASTBURNYEAR column.
* In perGrass.csv:
    * deleted 21_4 data for 2001
    * deleted 40_10 data for 1998
    * recalculated average and standard dev for 2010, BP 7_1
    * fixed missing years for BP 7_1
    
## Wiregrass (perinnieal grass) datasets:

* pergrass.csv **main wiregrass dataset.**  Raw, but note processing steps above.  Some data deleted. 
* herbWU.csv spreadsheet for working up the wiregrass data

* Beatriz provided additional cleaning.  Her notes and cleaned data are in an Excel file named [Copy of Herbaceous data - BPA.  This data replaced all other data and was pasted into other herb datasets.
