This document serves to document changes made to datasets (will be repeated on website), link to and describe datasets.

## Goals and deliverables Phase 1
In general the aim of Phase 1 for ABRP is to get the data wrangled and to provide input that guides future monitoring, and eventually management.  

**Deliverables**

1. Cleaned datasets
2. Charts of pine stems and wiregrass
3. LANDFIRE Maps and charts
4. Website with downloadable code

## Pine Data Wrangling
* worked from data delivered by Beatriz (ABRP_bioplots_1995-2018)[LINK]
* added "B-P" column, concatenated BU and Plot numbers to generate unique value for charts
* added MONYEAR and LASTBURNYEAR columns for charts (also, some burns only had years recorded).  Used "text to columns" tool in Excel with "/" as the delimiter to create new YEAR-based columns where possible.  Manually entered years for many records.
* Bull-dozing happened (instead of fire?) for MONYEAR 2007, B-Ps 7_8, 7_7, 7_6, and 7_4.  Did not transfer this information to LASTBURNYEAR (but is is in LASTBURN column). Swaty did not want to mix numerical and text data types in the LASTBURNYEAR column.
* B-Ps 7_3, 7_5 was missing MONDATE information for 2019.  Swaty manually entered "2019" based on exploring neighboring plots in the dataset.
* Found many typos and case issues (e.g., "Seedling" instead of "SEEDLING")
* In pine.csv:
    * deleted 21_4 data for 2001
    * deleted 40_10 data for 1998
    
**Note-deletions only done in "pine.csv".  ABRP_bioplots_1995-2018 was left intact.**
    
## Pine Data Descriptions
There are multiple files with "pine" in the name.  Most were for charts.

1. pine.csv main dataset.  Raw, but note processing steps above.  Some data deleted.
2. for comparing stem counts to reference sites (BU 5)
    * averagePineStemsBU
    * pineBU5all
    * pineStemsBU5average (intermediate dataset. Not used in charts.)
3. For heatmaps
    * pineDiverge (intermediate dataset. Not used in charts.)
    * fiveStems (intermediate dataset. Not used in charts.)
    * comparePineClean (intermediate dataset. Not used in charts.)
